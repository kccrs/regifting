        <h3 class="setup-page-subheader">1. Enter Your Login Info</h3>
        <p class="part-one-body">
          You will need to enter in your name, email address, mailing address, payment information, and the worst gift you have ever received. Aside from the latter, this process should be familiar to you. We ask for your worst ever gift because we enter all new customers in a monthly contest in which the worst gift wins six months free service.

        We offer two services: mail-order barcodes to track all your thoughtful but unappreciated gifts, and an Amazon integration where you can enter your information on Amazon. We offer a discount for purchasers of both services and also offer an option to sign in with Amazon.
